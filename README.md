His country's main trading partners including the Caricom member states and other countries in the Americas. Coordinating meetings with other members states can be challenging at times as they span 5 different time zones. He sometimes gets requests to change his times into Atlantic Standard Time (used by St Lucia) or Eastern Standard Time (used by Jamaica) to be consistent with the majority of member states.
